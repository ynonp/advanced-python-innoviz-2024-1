Practice time until 12:20

# Ex 1:

Create a decorator "max5" that calls the decorated
function maximum 5 times.
In the 6th time (or later) function raises an Exception

# Ex 2:
Create a decorator "memoized" that calls the decorated
function and saves the result.
When the function is called again with the same input,
don't re-calculate, but return the saved result
